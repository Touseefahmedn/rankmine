RankMine Super App - PWA package (modern)

Files included:
- index.html       -> Modern app UI (home screen with buttons)
- manifest.json    -> PWA manifest
- service-worker.js-> Simple cache for offline shell
- icons/*          -> Placeholder icons (replace with your logos)
- Instructions.txt -> How to host & enable Add to Home Screen

How to use (quick):
1. Host these files on any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) OR on your own domain.
2. If you host on GitHub Pages, the start URL will be like: https://username.github.io/repo/index.html
   Users visiting that URL can Add to Home Screen (Android will show prompt when PWA criteria met).
3. The buttons open your Blogspot pages in a new fullscreen window/tab (full-screen when installed).
4. Replace icons/* with your real 192x192 and 512x512 PNGs for proper app icon.

Note on traffic & Blogspot:
- The app is a small shell that links to your Blogspot pages. Users will click buttons and land on your Blogspot pages.
- For maximum Blogspot-first traffic, consider linking start_url directly to your Blogspot page instead of index.html.
